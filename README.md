### Architecture Overview

Brand Guardian AI follows a full-stack architecture, separating the frontend and backend for better maintainability and scalability.

1.  **Frontend (React/Inertia.js/TypeScript):**  Handles user interactions, data presentation, and makes API requests to the backend.  Uses components for reusability and maintainability.
2.  **Backend (Laravel):**  Manages business logic, API endpoints, database interactions, authentication, and authorization.
3.  **Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL):** Stores persistent data like user accounts, brand guidelines, and detected inconsistencies.
4.  **AI Service (OpenAI API or similar):** Provides AI capabilities for analyzing brand guidelines and detecting inconsistencies.
5.  **Real-time Updates (Redis/Laravel Echo Server):** Pushes real-time updates about detected inconsistencies to the frontend through WebSockets.

**Key Components:**

*   **Laravel (Backend):** Handles API requests, database interactions, business logic, authentication, and authorization.
*   **React/Inertia.js (Frontend):** Provides the user interface, handles user interactions, and displays data received from the backend. Inertia.js simplifies the integration of React with Laravel.
*   **TypeScript:** Adds static typing to the frontend, improving code quality and developer productivity.
*   **Redis:** Used as a message broker for real-time updates.
*   **Laravel Echo Server:** Enables WebSocket connections for real-time communication between the server and clients.

### Testing

*   **Backend (Laravel):**

    *   We recommend using [Pest](https://pestphp.com/) for writing unit and feature tests.

    *   Run tests using:

        ```bash
        ./vendor/bin/pest
        ```

*   **Frontend (React):**

    *   We recommend using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for component testing.

    *   Run tests using:

        ```bash
        npm run test  # or yarn test
        ```

*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**

    *   We recommend using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) or [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for E2E testing.

### Deployment

A typical deployment process would involve:

1.  **Containerizing the application using Docker (optional but highly recommended).**
2.  **Pushing the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google Container Registry).**
3.  **Deploying the application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean) using Kubernetes or a similar orchestration tool.**
4.  **Configuring a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to serve static assets (e.g., JavaScript, CSS, images).**
5.  **Setting up a managed database service (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL) for scalability and reliability.**
6.  **Configuring load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple backend instances.**
7.  **Setting up monitoring and alerting to track the health and performance of the application.**

### Monetization Strategy

Brand Guardian AI will operate on a subscription-based pricing model, tiered based on the following factors:

*   **Number of users:** The more users an organization needs to support, the higher the tier.
*   **Connected platforms:** Pricing increases with the number of online platforms connected for scanning (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Website, Email Marketing).
*   **Frequency of brand checks:**  Tiers can differ based on how often the system scans for inconsistencies (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).

A **free tier** will be offered with limited checks per month to generate leads and allow potential customers to experience the platform's value.
